# wikinft

Wikipedia is one of the greatest creations of the online world. The rise of AI threatens to make the generation of wikipedia sized datasets easy. While AI is increadible in its ability to amplify a human's creativity it can also be easily used to dupe a person into perceiving a world which is not real. See [InsidiousAI](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/insidious/ggagkncjchhmgfoohllfgoohjalmngcf) as an example.

We are in a golden moment, AI is available to us but hasn't yet completely flooded all that we hold dear. We should make clear a clear record of all human-generated data we hold dear, before we are incapable of seperating it from AI content.

Wikinft has a simple function to achieve this goal: we merkelise the entirity of the text based english version of wikipedia (other versions in the works). With this merkelisation and a publicly known address on Ethereum (or in this case, starknet) we can prove that wikipedia looked a certain way before the age of AI.

We use a merkle hash of the pages so that you can easily verify inclusion of an individual page, without having to download the entirity of wikipedia yourself. 

The merkelisation also leads readily to the ability to make NFTs representing the pages from wikipedia itself. This is not the goal of the project, however, by launching an NFT collection to Starknet, the most important pages could be made available on that blockchain forever. If the page is important enough for someone to boast about owning it in a joke way, it's important enough to remember forever.
